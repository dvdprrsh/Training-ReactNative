# Training-ReactNative
These are the small projects that I made while following the Udemy course 'The Complete React Native + Hooks Course [2019 Edition]' by Stephen Grider.

## Usage
To use the web applications download/clone the repository and navigate to one of the applications' root directories in a command shell and run 'npm start', the expo application debugger may then open in your browser, if it does not, then press 'd'. Follow the instructions to start the application in an emulator/physical device.

Some of the applications may require different methods of starting up and some may need other services running and so may not work all the time, sorry for any inconveniance caused.
